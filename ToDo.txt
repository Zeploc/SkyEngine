Adjust UI to use current window size
Give option to attach programs on other windows without repeating whole process?
Change singletons (shader, camera etc) to like Input system (singleton changes based on current window)
Or instead of above system, store map of inputs to each window and select based on current window?
Change UI bindings (buttons) to be able to use member functions
